# Bank-Loan_Project
This project is my project in sprint 2, which is Data Preprocessing.

In this sprint, I learned how to compensate for imperfect data, convert data types, and handle missing also duplicate values.

# Project Overview 
In this project I will try to analyze Risk of Default in Loan Repayment, the main goal to provide insight when bank need to make a credit assessment for prospective borrowers. The following is the conclusion that I have drawn after working on the project.

After analyzing the data, and testing we could give answers to following questions:
1. Is there a correlation between having children and the probability of someone defaulting on a loan?
    There is no correlation, as reflected by the data that families without children also have a default rate similar to families with children.

2. Is there a correlation between marital status and the probability of someone defaulting on a loan?
    Yes, Clients with a civil partnership or unmarried family status have a higher default rate percentage compared to customers with a family status of married or divorced.
    
3. Is there a correlation between income levels and the probability of someone defaulting on a loan?
    Clients with low-income levels have a higher risk of default, and this risk decreases as their income increases.

4. How does the difference in loan purposes affect the probability of someone defaulting on a loan?
    Clients who borrow for property-related purposes have the lowest risk of default, followed by those borrowing for marriage-related purposes. The highest default risk is associated with borrowing for education and car-related purposes.

Based on the analysis, the marketing team can consider the following recommendations:
1. Target marketing efforts towards married individuals or those who are divorced as they have a lower probability of defaulting on a loan compared to individuals with a civil partnership or unmarried family status.

2. Consider income level when assessing creditworthiness and risk. Clients with low-income levels have a higher risk of default, so it may be beneficial to set lower credit limits or offer more affordable payment plans for these clients.

3. Focus on promoting loans for property-related purposes, as clients who borrow for these reasons have the lowest risk of default.
